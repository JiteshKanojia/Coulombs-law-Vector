# Coulombs-law-Vector
C++ code to calculate the force exerted by a charge Q1 on another charge Q2 in cartesian vector form 
I created this because i had an exam in the upcoming week about electromagnetic engineering and ended up procrastinating making this :p

The code can be improved a lot but i hardly think anyone would need this XD
